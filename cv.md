# **Summary** #

I am working in the sphere of tourism and started learning programming a few months ago because I wanted to change the sphere of work and I like to learn new interesting things. As long as I continue learning, programming involves me more and more. When I have any spare time, I am trying to write some code or do tasks, and I really understand that I can spend hours doing this job. That is why I enrolled in Web Development courses at RSSchool. My goal is to start with web-development and, after a few years of gaining experience, I'd like to take some back-end courses to become a full-stack developer. I want to build large, high-quality, and user-friendly websites and applications in the future.
